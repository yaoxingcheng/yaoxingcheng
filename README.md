### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are some basic facts about myself.

- I'm currently an undergraduate student at [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), THU.
- I know basic knowledge about deep machine learning, including:
  - commonly used neural network models, such as Transformer, LSTM, GNN and CNN
  - commonly used pipeline in NLP or CV.
  - some frameworks to train deep ML models such as [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- Currently my knowledge is limited in domains like:
  - compiler
  - network
  - hardware devices
- Avatar was recommended by my ex. It's here to remind myself: Those who donâ€™t work hard will lose their love.

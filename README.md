### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are some basic facts about myself.

- I know basic knowledge about deep machine learning, including:
  - commonly used neural network models, such as Transformer, LSTM, GNN and CNN.
  - commonly used pipeline in NLP or CV.
  - some frameworks to train deep ML models such as [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- Currently my knowledge is limited in domains like:
  - compiler
  - hardware devices
- Now interested in autonomous driving system.
